## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with BEM naming conventions
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me practice basic React component composition, semantic html markup and styling with css. My project utilizes a concise html markup and streamline css to provide the most efficient solution.  My css styles have been organized by typography, reusuable classes, and specific id's/classes for easy future modification.  

### Continued development

In future projects I want to utilize stateful React components, improve my understanding of semantic html markup and css properties, and learn about module bundlers like webpack.
